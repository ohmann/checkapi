A.Gathering traces in BSD
=========================
A d script is provided, which can be used to gather traces on BSD systems. Use
it like this:

    dtrace_bsd.d -o <output_name.dtrace> -c "<command with arguments>"

Please note the quotes around the command and arguments. Also note that dtrace
can only run with ROOT priviledges under BSD.

When trying to run the d script the following error might come up:

  dtrace: failed to initialize dtrace: DTrace device not available on system

If this happens, dtrace is not configured in your system. Dtrace is not 
supported by default on BSD systems. The kernel needs to be customized before 
dtrace can be used. See below for instructions on how to do this.


B.Gathering simple test traces
==============================
A C program is provided under the syscalls directory which can be used to 
explicitly run certain system calls. This program can be used in combination 
with the dtrace script to gather simple traces of specific system calls.


C.Parsing traces
================
A parser is provided:
    
    python parser.py <trace_file>


D.Setting up DTrace on BSD
==========================
Links with some very useful information on how to do this are given at the end 
of this section. I found that on my BSD system (FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE) the 
instructions given were not enough to set up DTrace so I list the steps I 
followed here:
  
  1. Find your kernel configuration file. Mine was here: /usr/src/sys/i386/conf
  2. Backup your GENERIC kernel configuration file in you home directory.
  3. Copy the GENERIC conf file and give it another name e.g MYKERNEL. This will
     be your customized kernel configuration file.
  4. Insert the following lines in your customized kernel file.
       options         KDTRACE_HOOKS
       options         DDB_CTF
  5. Change directory to /usr/src
  6. Run the command: "make WITH_CTF=1 buildkernel KERNCONF=MYKERNEL" This will 
     take a while to complete.
  7. Run the command: "make WITH_CTF=1 installkernel KERNCONF=MYKERNEL"
  8. Restart your system.
  9. Go to /usr/ports/shells/ksh93
  10.Run make install clean
  11.Go to /usr/ports/sysutils/DTraceToolkit.
  12.Run make install clean
  13.Run kldload dtraceall. You will probably have to do this every time you
     start your system
  14.You should now be able to run dtrace on your system.
