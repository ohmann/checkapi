Gathering traces in Linux
=========================

Traces in Linux can be gathered using strace. The suggested way of 
using strace is:

strace -v -f -s1024 -o output_filename command

-v print structure values unabbreviated.
-f trace child processes
-s1024 allow string arguments in system calls up to 1024 characters. 
       If this option is skipped, strace will truncate strings 
       exceeding 32 characters.



Gathering simple test traces
============================

A C program is provided under the syscalls directory which can be used
to explicitly run certain system calls. This program can be used in
combination with strace to gather simple traces of specific system
calls.
