A.Gathering traces in Linux
===========================

Traces in Linux can be gathered using the strace utility (man strace). The
expected options to use with strace to gather traces that can be parsed by the
parser provided in this project is the following:

    strace -v -f -s1024 -o output_filename command

Options:
-v print structure values unabbreviated (verbose).
-f follow and trace child processes
-s1024 allow string arguments in system calls up to 1024 characters. If this 
option is skipped, strace will truncate strings exceeding 32 characters.


B.Gathering simple test traces
==============================
A C program is provided under the syscalls directory which can be used to 
explicitly run certain system calls. This program can be used in combination 
with strace to gather simple traces of specific system calls. Running the 
syscall program.

    make
    ./syscalls help           # prints usage information.
    ./syscalls list           # lists all system calls supported by this program.
    ./syscalls syscall_name   # executes the system call indicated by syscall_name.

Usually the indicated system call will be executed more than once, with
different options each time, in order to provide more information when traced.

Example using the syscalls program and the strace utility to generate a trace
file of a specific system call:

    make
    strace -v -f -s1024 -o open.strace ./syscalls open

In this example we use strace to trace the system calls involved when running
the command "./syscalls open". This will generate a file called "open.strace"
which will contain several traced system calls, one in each line. Towards the 
end of this file there should be two lines similar to the following ones:

    3579  open("syscalls.txt", O_RDONLY|O_CREAT, 0664) = 3
    3579  open("syscalls2.txt", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_APPEND, 0664) = 4

These two lines are examples of the strace output format, when tracing the open
system call.

Similrly to tracing the "syscall" program, strace can be used to trace any
application. For example:
    
    strace -v -f -s1024 -o cat.strace cat > test.txt
    strace -v -f -s1024 -o firefox.strace firefox www.google.com


C.Parsing traces
================
Once a trace is gathered and stored in a trace file using a tracing utility such
as "strace", it can then be parsed. The POSIX Omni Tracer (POT) is provided,
able to parse trace files coming from different tracing utilities in different
operating systems, such as strace, truss and dtrace.
Using the POT parser:

    export REPY_PATH="`pwd`"         # required to generate the lind file system
    python parser.py <trace_file> [trace_type]

Arguments:
- trace_file is the file containing the output of the tracing utility, in this
case the strace output.
- trace_type is an optional second argument that indicates which tool was used 
to generate the trace_file, for example strace. This argument is only needed if 
the type of the trace_file cannot be automaitically inferred.
