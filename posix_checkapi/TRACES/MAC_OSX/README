A.Gathering traces in Mac OS X
==============================
A d script is provided, which can be used to gather traces on OSX systems. Use
it like this:

    dtrace_osx.d -o <output_name.dtrace> -c "<command with arguments>"

Please note the quotes around the command and arguments. Also note that dtrace
can only run with ROOT priviledges under OSX.


B.Gathering simple test traces
==============================
A C program is provided under the syscalls directory which can be used to 
explicitly run certain system calls. This program can be used in combination 
with the dtrace script to gather simple traces of specific system calls.


C.Parsing traces
================
A parser is provided:
    
    python parser.py <trace_file>
