Module: A simple library that provides a unique ID for each call

Start date: November 11th, 2008

This is a really, really simple module, only broken out to avoid duplicating 
functionality.

NOTE: This will give unique ids PER FILE.   If you have multiple python 
modules that include this, they will have the potential to generate the
same ID.
