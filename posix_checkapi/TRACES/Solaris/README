A.Gathering traces in Solaris
=============================
Traces in Solaris can be gathered using truss. The expected way of using truss 
to gather traces that can be parsed by our parser is:

truss -f -rall -wall -vall -o output_filename command

-f trace child processes
-rall shows full contents of I/O buffer for the read syscall
-wall shows full contents of I/O buffer for the write syscall
-vall display contents of structures (instead of there address)
