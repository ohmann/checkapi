A.Gathering traces in Solaris
=============================
Traces in Solaris can be gathered using truss. The expected options to use with 
truss to gather traces that can be parsed by the parser provided in this 
project is the following:

    truss -f -rall -wall -vall -o output_filename command

Options:
-f follow and trace child processes.
-rall shows full contents of I/O buffer for the read syscall.
-wall shows full contents of I/O buffer for the write syscall.
-vall display contents of structures (instead of their address)
