Purpose: This module provides condition variable (cv) interface.

Abstract: Conceptually a condition variable is a queue of threads, 
associated with a semaphore upon which a thread(s) may wait for some 
assertion to become true. Thus each condition variable is associated with 
some assertion. While a thread is waiting upon a condition variable, that 
thread is not considered to occupy the semaphore, and so other threads may
enter the semaphore to notify the waiting thread(s).

Thread-Safety: Safe to call notify_one()/notify_all()/wait()
concurrently. However, in case you call destroy() make sure this
is a last call for that conditional variable -- otherwise you will
receive an exception about invalid handle.
